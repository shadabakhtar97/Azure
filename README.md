# What is Docker ?
The Docker open-source platform has revolutionized the way we create, deploy, and manage containerized applications




# Azure Docker Notes Deep Dive
Installation Docker on Azure VM NAME="Ubuntu" and VERSION="20.04.6 LTS (Focal Fossa)"

$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt install docker.io -y

# How to start docker ?
$ sudo service docker start

# How to check docker status?
$ sudo service docker status

# How to check docker images?
$ sudo docker image ls

$ sudo docker images

# How to check docker container?
$ sudo docker container ls

$ sudo docker ps

# How to stop container ?
$ sudo docker container stop container-id

# How to add Docker in sudo group?
To create the docker group and add your user:

Create the docker group

$ sudo groupadd docker

Add your user to the docker group

$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated

Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo 

# What Is Docker Expose Port?
The expose keyword in a Dockerfile tells Docker that a container listens for traffic on the specified port

So, for a container running a web server, you might add this to your Dockerfile: 

EXPOSE 80

# Exposing Docker ports via EXPOSE or â€“expose
There are two ways of exposing ports in Docker:

Including an EXPOSE instruction in the Dockerfile
Using the -expose flag at runtime

EXPOSE Example:
----------------
EXPOSE 80

-expose Example:
----------------
docker run --expose=8080 test

docker run --expose=2000-3000 test

# Azure Application Gateway
### ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer and application delivery controller (ADC) service provided by Microsoft Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform. It acts as a reverse proxy service that enables you to manage and optimize the traffic to your web applications.

Here are some key features and functionalities of Azure Application Gateway:

1. **Load Balancing:** Application Gateway can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers or instances, ensuring high availability and improved performance of your applications.

2. **SSL Termination:** It can handle SSL/TLS termination, relieving your backend servers from the computational overhead of encryption and decryption. This also allows for better security by offloading SSL/TLS processing to the Application Gateway.

3. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Application Gateway includes a Web Application Firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits and vulnerabilities. It can be configured to provide security against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other threats.

4. **Session Affinity:** You can configure session affinity to ensure that a user's requests are always directed to the same backend server, which is important for applications that require session persistence.

5. **URL-Based Routing:** You can configure routing rules based on URL paths to direct traffic to different backend pools. This allows you to set up complex routing scenarios for your applications.

6. **Cookie-Based Affinity:** Application Gateway supports sticky sessions based on cookies, allowing you to maintain session affinity based on cookies generated by your application.

7. **Health Probing:** It continuously monitors the health of your backend servers and automatically routes traffic away from unhealthy servers to maintain application availability.

8. **Websocket Support:** Application Gateway can handle WebSocket traffic, which is essential for real-time web applications.

9. **Scaling:** You can scale Application Gateway horizontally by adding or removing instances to handle increased traffic loads.

10. **Integrated Metrics and Logging:** Azure Application Gateway provides various metrics and logs that can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting your application traffic.

11. **Rewrite and Redirect Rules:** You can configure rewrite and redirect rules to modify the URLs of incoming requests.

12. **Authentication and Authorization:** You can use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication and authorization with Application Gateway to secure your applications.

13. **Custom Domains and SSL Certificates:** You can configure custom domains and SSL certificates to ensure that your applications are accessible via secure and user-friendly URLs.

Azure Application Gateway is a valuable service for organizations hosting web applications in Azure, as it helps ensure application availability, security, and performance by managing and controlling incoming traffic effectively. It can be used in conjunction with other Azure services like Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure App Service to create robust and scalable application architectures.

### SSL and TLS stand for:

1. **SSL:** Secure Sockets Layer
2. **TLS:** Transport Layer Security

These are cryptographic protocols used to secure internet communications and data transmission between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. SSL was the predecessor to TLS, and over time, TLS has become the more commonly used and secure protocol. Both protocols ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged over a network, such as the internet, by encrypting the data and verifying the identity of the parties involved in the communication.
